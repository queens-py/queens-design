# Corporate Design

Logos for the [QUEENS project](https://github.com/queens-py/queens)
</div>

# Name
The official name of the project is QUEENS. Always spell it with uppercase letters.

# Colors
The color in the QUEENS logos has the hex code `#2C6572` or `rgba(44, 101, 114)`.

For a light accent color use the hex code `#A3CDD6` or `rgba(163, 205, 214)`.

# Font
The font in the QUEENS logos is Outfit Regular 400  (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) with a modified letter Q.

# Logo Integrity Standards
- Primary option: The primary option is the horizontal option which contains the crown with the name QUEENS on the right side.
It is available [here](./logo/) as `queens_text.*`.
It is preferable to use the primary logo over the QUEENS crown alone which is available as `queens_crown.*` [here](./crown/).
- Night logo (for dark backgrounds): To ensure sufficient contrast and legibility, we provide the primary option as a night logo for dark backgrounds.
It is available [here](./logo/) as `queens_text_night.*`.
- Minimum size: Please do not display the QUEENS logos at less than 24 px (screen) or 7 mm (print) height to ensure legibility. 
- Scale: Ensure the logo is always scaled proportionally. Do not display a distorted version of the logo.
- Clear space: Make sure to keep an appropriate amount of clear space around the logo. Do not overlap the logo with text, images, or other elements.
- Do not try to recreate or modify the QUEENS logos or parts of the logos.
