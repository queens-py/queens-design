# Corporate Design

Logos for the [QUEENS project](https://github.com/queens-py/queens)
</div>

# Name
The official name of the project is QUEENS. Do not abbreviate or otherwise alter the name. Always spell it with uppercase letters.

# Colors
The color in the QUEENS logo has the hex code `#2C6572` or `rgba(44, 101, 114)`.

# Font
The font in the QUEENS logo is Outfit Regular 400  (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit).

# Logo Integrity Standards
- Primary option: The primary option is the horizontal option (crown with the name QUEENS on the right side (add full file names) `queens_text` or `queens_text_night`). It is preferable to use the primary logo over the crown (`queens_crown`) alone.
- Night version: To ensure sufficient contrast and legibility, we provide the primary option as a `night` version for dark backgrounds.
- Minimum size: Please do not display the QUEENS crown logo at less than 20px wide and the primary QUEENS logo at less than 50px wide to ensure legibility. 
- Scale: Ensure the logo is always scaled proportionally. Do not display a distorted version of the logo.
- Clear space: Make sure to keep an appropriate amount of clear space around the logo. Do not overlap the logo with text, images, or other elements.
- Do not try to recreate or modify the QUEENS logo or parts of the logo.
